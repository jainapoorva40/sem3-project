PROBLEM STATEMENT:

Traditionally the method in which customers specify their desired menu to the waiter who takes the order on a paper. Personally, he then takes the order to the kitchen department and then he supply the food item to the customer. So, it was a time-consuming process. It leads to wastage of paper and also it requires reprinting of all menu cards. Also, in many cases for small change to be making in menu card it is not convenient to print all menu cards again and again. Simply saying that the menu card once printed canâ€™t be changed. After some days, the menu card lost its worthy look and attractiveness.

APPROACH:
DATA STRUCTURE:
We used Double linked list in this code , so that by the use of doubly linked list we can easily traverse the linked list and make it easy to find any node. We use Linked list so that we can easily delete any node (just make node->pre->next=node->next and node->next->pre=node->pre).

Conclusion:
This   project   has   really   been   faithful   and   informative.   It   has   made   us   learn   and understand the many concepts of C Language. As this project is made using various concepts of the C language like Linked list , Structure , Functions , memory allocation using malloc , Pointers , Menu Driven program etc.
